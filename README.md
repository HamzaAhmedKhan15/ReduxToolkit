State Management Simplified: Redux Toolkit provides utilities to streamline Redux workflows, reducing boilerplate code and making state management more intuitive.

Configure Redux Store: It helps in setting up the Redux store with minimal setup, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than configuring the store.

Immutability with Ease: Redux Toolkit encourages immutable updates to state, ensuring predictable behavior. It provides convenient functions like immer integration for writing immutable update logic more concisely.

Simplified Action Creation: With Redux Toolkit, you can create actions using the createSlice function, which combines action creators and reducers into a single function, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

Enhanced Dev Tools Integration: Redux Toolkit seamlessly integrates with Redux DevTools Extension, providing developers with powerful debugging capabilities, including time-travel debugging and state inspection, to ease the development and debugging process.
